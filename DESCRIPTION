Description: scHolography is a deep learning workflow to reconstruct tissue 3D structures from scRNA-seq data based on spatial transcriptomic (ST) references. From scHolography prediction, users can identify spatial expression dynamics and dissect the heterogeneity of spatial neighborhoods within reconstructed tissues.
